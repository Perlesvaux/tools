=== GOOGLE DRIVE ===

When you share an image via Google Drive, you get a link like this:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhbqUPFqqMtmcyFoQ6QUjHOnMtATN9kO/view?usp=sharing

PROBLEM: That link goes to an interface to see the image, not to the image itself, thus it can't be used in an <img> tag.

SOLUTION: Replace "file/d/" with "uc?id=", like this:

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nhbqUPFqqMtmcyFoQ6QUjHOnMtATN9kO

That link goes to the image itself, thus it can be used in an <img> tag. You now have free Google Drive image hosting!

=== TWITTER (X) ===

In Twitter (now X), a tweet's link has the form:

twitter.com/<user identifier>/status/<tweet id>

PROBLEM: If you save one such link, the user can change his identifier, rendering your link useless.

SOLUTION: You can use the "anyuser" identifier and the url will redirect to the tweet, with the correct user identifier.

For instance, if you go to:

twitter.com/anyuser/status/541278904204668929

The link redirects to:

https://twitter.com/MarkTabNet/status/541278904204668929

PROBLEM: You want to cite a tweet's video, not the entire tweet, just the video.

SOLUTION: If the link of the tweet (whose video you want to cite) is:

https://twitter.com/LucAuffret/status/1716085946016252251

Simply append "/video/1" to it when writing your citing tweet, like this:

https://twitter.com/LucAuffret/status/1716085946016252251/video/1

If the cited tweet has more than one video, change the number at the end of that URL to pick the one you want.

=== Mercury Mail Server ===

PROBLEM: After installing XAMPP, the PHP function mail() doesn't work out of the box.

To send and receive email, you must have a mail server, the one that comes with XAMPP is Mercury, which can be started on the XAMPP control panel.

Before starting Mercury, follow one of the solutions below:

SOLUTIONS:

1. For local testing in Windows, you don't need an external address to send or receive emails, you can send emails to yourself with Mercury:

  In php.ini, the [mail function] section should look like this (ignoring comments [lines starting with ";"]):

  SMTP=localhost
  smtp_port=25
  sendmail_from = postmaster@localhost
  mail.add_x_header=Off


  "SMTP" stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

  A mail must have a "From" header. "sendmail_from" indicates the default email address PHP will use in the From header (that is: the default sender address) when calling mail().

  If you don't want to set "sendmail_from" (or if you have but want to use a different sender address) you must pass a From header to mail() (see mail()'s documentation to see how).

  In the Mercury mail server, "postmaster" is an alias for the admin user, its mail is "postmaster@localhost" and its mailbox is at XAMPP > MercuryMail > MAIL > Admin

2. # TO DO.

=== SETUP GIT TO PUSH TO GITHUB ===

PROBLEM: I can't push current local branch to my remote GitHub repo.

CLARIFICATION: Git and GitHub need an email address to sign your commits, so they can be attributed to you (you can run "git log" to see the username and email of the author of each commit). In Git you set the email like this:

git config --global user.email 'your_email@google.com'

GitHub, on the other hand, will prompt you to verify an email address (you can verify a primary email and many backup emails).

In "GitHub > Settings > Emails" you can enable the option "Keep my email addresses private"; if you do, GitHub will sign your commits (and any other contribution activity, like creating a repo, opening a pull request, opening an issue, etc.) with an email address of the form "<numeric_Id>+<your_Username>@users.noreply.github.com" (such that any activity signed with that email will appear in your GitHub contribution graph).

If you don't enable the option "Keep my email addresses private", GitHub will sign your commits with your account's (verified) primary email address (such that any activity signed with that email will appear in your GitHub contribution graph).

SOLUTION:

In Git, set your username and email to be the same as you GitHub's (if you enabled the option "Keep my email addresses private", you must set Git's global "user.email" to your GitHub-given email address of the form "<numeric_Id>+<your_Username>@users.noreply.github.com"), like this:

git config --global user.name 'your_GitHub_Username'
git config --global user.email '<numeric_Id>+<your_Username>@users.noreply.github.com'

Then run:

apt install gh

When the installation is done, run:

gh auth login

And follow the interactive prompts. That's it! Try pushing to a remote repo with:

git push

Or with:

git push origin

If you still can't push, perhaps the remote repo is not mapped to the local repo; check that with:

git remote show

That shows the remote repos mapped to your local repo. If that shows nothing, that means there's no remote repo mapped to your local repo. To map a remote repo to your local repo, run:

git remote add origin github.com/your_GitHub_Username/repo_name

That tells git: "github.com/your_GitHub_Username/repo_name" is the remote that corresponds to this local repo (git should pull from there and push to there), and "origin" will be its local name, such that whenever I refer to "origin" (such as in "git push origin"), I'm talking about "github.com/your_GitHub_Username/repo_name".

You should be able to push after that.
