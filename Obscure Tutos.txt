=== GOOGLE DRIVE ===

When you share an image via Google Drive, you get a link like this:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhbqUPFqqMtmcyFoQ6QUjHOnMtATN9kO/view?usp=sharing

PROBLEM: That link goes to an interface to see the image, not to the image itself, thus it can't be used in an <img> tag.

SOLUTION: Replace "file/d/" with "uc?id=", like this:

https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nhbqUPFqqMtmcyFoQ6QUjHOnMtATN9kO

That link goes to the image itself, thus it can be used in an <img> tag. You now have free Google Drive image hosting!

=== TWITTER (X) ===

In Twitter (now X), a tweet's link has the form:

twitter.com/<user identifier>/status/<tweet id>

PROBLEM: If you save one such link, the user can change his identifier, rendering your link useless.

SOLUTION: You can use the "anyuser" identifier and the url will redirect to the tweet, with the correct user identifier.

For instance, if you go to:

twitter.com/anyuser/status/541278904204668929

The link redirects to:

https://twitter.com/MarkTabNet/status/541278904204668929

PROBLEM: You want to cite a tweet's video, not the entire tweet, just the video.

SOLUTION: If the link of the tweet (whose video you want to cite) is:

https://twitter.com/LucAuffret/status/1716085946016252251

Simply append "/video/1" to it when writing your citing tweet, like this:

https://twitter.com/LucAuffret/status/1716085946016252251/video/1

If the cited tweet has more than one video, change the number at the end of that URL to pick the one you want.

=== Mercury Mail Server ===

PROBLEM: After installing XAMPP, the PHP function mail() doesn't work out of the box.

To send and receive email, you must have a mail server, the one that comes with XAMPP is Mercury, which can be started on the XAMPP control panel.

Before starting Mercury, follow one of the solutions below:

SOLUTIONS:

1. For local testing in Windows, you don't need an external address to send or receive emails, you can send emails to yourself with Mercury:

  In php.ini, the [mail function] section should look like this (ignoring comments [lines starting with ";"]):

  SMTP=localhost
  smtp_port=25
  sendmail_from = postmaster@localhost
  mail.add_x_header=Off


  "SMTP" stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.

  A mail must have a "From" header. "sendmail_from" indicates the default email address PHP will use in the From header (that is: the default sender address) when calling mail().

  If you don't want to set "sendmail_from" (or if you have but want to use a different sender address) you must pass a From header to mail() (see mail()'s documentation to see how).

  In the Mercury mail server, "postmaster" is an alias for the admin user, its mail is "postmaster@localhost" and its mailbox is at XAMPP > MercuryMail > MAIL > Admin
